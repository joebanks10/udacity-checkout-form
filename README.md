# Checkout Form

My solution for the checkout form [quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2rWAO4fqow) from Udacity's course: Building High Conversion Forms. I'm taking this course as part of the Senior Web Developer Nanodegree.

I used the following resources:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for working with the DOM
- [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) and the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#ReverseGeocoding) for looking up the user's current location's address.
